# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
## _Welcome to Sorting Algorithm Visualizer._
>I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action.
> A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts the elements of a list in a certain order. In this implementation of sorting visualizer, we'll be looking at some of these sorting algorithms and visually comprehend their working.

### The sorting algorithms covered here are :
- Bubble Sort 
- Linear Sort 
- Selection Sort 
- Insertion Sort 
- Heap Sort 
- Merge Sort 
- Quick Sort

### Features
- Time and Space complexcity analysis.
- Speed of visualization selection.
- Bar colour selection.
